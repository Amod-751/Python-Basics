It\\'s popular because it\\'s easy to learn, versatile (used in web development, data science, automation, etc.), has a large standard library, strong community support, and runs across platforms.\\n\\n\\n2.What is an interpreter in Python?\\n\\t->An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code at runtime.\\n\\n\\n3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\\n\\t->Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable or function names). They define the syntax and structure of the Python language.\\nExamples include:\\nif, else, for, while,def, class, return,True, False, None,try, except, import etc.\\n\\n\\n4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\\n    ->No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved by the programming language.\\n\\n\\n5.What is mutability in Python?\\n    ->Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, sets) can be changed, while immutable objects (like strings, tuples, integers) cannot. \\n\\n\\n6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\\n\\t->Lists are mutable to allow flexible data manipulation. Tuples are immutable to ensure fixed, unchangeable data, enabling safe use as dictionary keys and set elements.\\n\\n\\n7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\\n\\t->== checks value equality – whether two variables have the same value.\\n\\tis checks identity – whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\\n\\n\\n8.What are logical operators in Python?\\n\\t->Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They include:\\nand – returns True if both conditions are True\\n\\nor – returns True if at least one condition is True\\n\\nnot – returns True if the condition is False\\n\\n\\n9.What is type casting in Python?\\n    ->Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another, such as from int to float or str.\\n\\n\\n10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\\n\\t->Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python, while explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer.\\n\\n\\n11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\\n\\t->The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of the program by executing certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met.\\nExample:\\nif age >= 18:\\n    \\t\\tprint(\"You can vote.\")\\n\\n\\n12.How does the elif statement work?\\n\\t->The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python checks another condition if the previous if condition was false.
